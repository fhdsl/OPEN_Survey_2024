## Interest in being a speaker/discussion leader

`r nrow(df %>% select(BeingGuestInterest) %>% mutate(BeingGuestInterest = recode(BeingGuestInterest, "No" = NA_character_)) %>% filter(!is.na(BeingGuestInterest)))` respondents expressed interest in being a speaker/discussion leader for future meetings. The topics that they suggested they could cover include 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## Speaker/Discussion leader recommendations

> Do you have recommendations of other speakers/discussion leaders you think would be great for an OPEN meeting?
